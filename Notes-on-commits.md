## Research consent and updates for migrating to 2.3
This commit makes some updates required for migrating to 2.3.
This commit creates the ability to track a research consent by users:  DB changes.  Institution will now have a research boolean (yes this institution has a research consent or not) and a research integer for users (0 no response, 1 yes, 2, no).  After update, db admin should update these two db fields setting institution.research appropriately and marca_user.research = 0.
