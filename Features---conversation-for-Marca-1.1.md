Let's use this space (and I'm mostly talking to myself here) to stash major development ideas for the next version of Marca, which I'm completely arbitrarily calling 1.1 (with the idea being that our current beta 0.something and our first non-beta release will be 1.0.

My one concern about using the wiki is that, as far as I know, edits don't send notifications, which is a feature I find really helpful on Issues. Any thoughts?

**Add any notes on the dev process here with date and name.  New bits on top.**

some sort of email notification for when events occur within classes. This could be very useful for both teachers (students enrolling, mainly, but I imagine there could be other uses) and students (new assignments posted, new posts on a thread you started). We'd have to think about how to do it smartly, perhaps with some sort of digest form--I don't imagine teachers carrying a four-course load would like 84 messages within a few days, each one letting them know a single student has enrolled, but it'd be nice to receive updates on activity
